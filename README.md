Some attempts
Import Libraries: cv2 is used for video capture and image processing, while numpy is used for numerical operations.
Video Capture: The application uses the first webcam connected to the computer (cv2.VideoCapture(0)).
Color Thresholding: A range of red in HSV is defined to detect red laser pointers. Adjust these values if your laser uses a different color.
Contour Detection: The application finds contours in the thresholded image, which allows it to detect distinct red regions.
Contour Filtering: Small contours are filtered out based on area to avoid false positives.
Display: Detected laser dots are visualized by outlining them and marking their centers.
Termination: The application exits the loop when the 'q' key is pressed.
Cleanup: Releases the webcam and closes windows upon exit.
